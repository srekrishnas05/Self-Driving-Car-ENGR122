## Hi there, My name is Sre, and here's all the files needed to recreate our ENGR122 Final Project! ##

I built a self driving/maneuvering robot that
1) Avoided obstacles using Ultrasonic Sensors
2) Used Lidar sensors to navigate to predetermined coordinates on a smart table
3) Performed mathematical cross product to adjust angle of movement for navigation
4) Consistently updated and displayed current coordinates onto a mobile OLED screen
